    <h1>Rebalance Regressive Tax Policies</h1>

    <p>Many of us, while benefitting from this government's taxation policies are frustrated at their disproportionate impact on the poor. So we're pledging to take the redistribution of wealth into our own hands.</p>

    <p>With this tool you can join us. Type in your gross income, and we'll calculate the tax cut you've been given this year, and provide some suggestions of ways to give that back to those in need.</p>
